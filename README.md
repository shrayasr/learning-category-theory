# Learning category theory

Long ago, I found an article on HN that spoke about Category theory for
programmers.  I read that expecting to not understand much but I actually
understood a little bit.

Been following Bartosz's articles since then but haven't had a chance to give
it a proper read. This repo will have my solutions to his challenges whenever I
get the time. And i'm choosing Clojure to write it in.

I'm really a n00b to all this. Heck I don't even know what category theory is
used for. But thats the point.
